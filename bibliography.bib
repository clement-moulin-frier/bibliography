The present paper will examine the subhypothesis that protosign {(S5)} formed a scaffolding for protospeech {(S6),} but that the two interacted with each other in supporting the evolution of brain and body that made Homo sapiens “language-ready”.},

  Abstract                 = {Part 1 offers a novel computational model of how a listener comes to understand the speech of someone speaking the listener's native language with a foreign accent. While involving a number of simplifications (which we discuss), we suggest that the core tenet of the model is a useful approximation: the listener uses hypotheses about the word the speaker is currently uttering to update probabilities linking the sound produced by the speaker to phonemes in the native language repertoire of the listener. This task seems to fly directly in the face of the basic hypothesis of the motor theory of speech perception, namely that we perceive the speech of another in terms of a motor representation of that speech. We thus assess claims for and against the motor theory of speech perception and the relevance of mirror neurons in terms of the present model of recognizing speech in a novel accent, earlier models of the adaptive formation of mirror neurons for grasping, and work emphasizing that the mirror system is only one part of a larger system for neurolinguistics processing.}

Recent work suggests that a similar founder effect may operate on human culture and language. Here I show that the number of phonemes used in a global sample of 504 languages is also clinal and fits a serial founder{\textendash}effect model of expansion from an inferred origin in Africa. This result, which is not explained by more recent demographic history, local language diversity, or statistical non-independence within language families, points to parallel mechanisms shaping genetic and linguistic diversity and supports an African origin of modern human languages.},

Les travaux présentés dans cette thèse s'inscrivent dans ce cadre de recherche. Nous avons utilisé une approche novatrice qui consiste en la simulation d'une société d'agents communicants. Le but est d'analyser dans quelle mesure un code linguistique commun est établi dans une telle société par le jeu de la communication parlée, et dans quelle mesure également les inventaires phonétiques émergent des principes d'interaction entre agents communicants. Nous avons développé un modèle d'échanges perceptifs de voyelles au sein d'une communauté d'agents de parole. Ce modèle, appelé ESPECE, a été validé à l'issue d'une application à la prédiction des systèmes vocaliques. Les résultats des simulations se sont avérés encourageants suite à leur confrontation aux données connues sur les inventaires phonétiques des langues du monde. En outre, le cadre de simulation ESPECE a été étendu en vue de la mise en oeuvre du principe du MUAF (Maximum Use of Available distinctive Features). Ce principe permet d'expliquer l'apparition de traits supplémentaires dans les larges systèmes vocaliques.},

The agents (small computer programs that operate autonomously) are equipped with a realistic articulatory synthesizer, a model of human perception and the ability to imitate and learn sounds they hear. It is shown that due to the interactions between the agents and due to self-organization, realistic vowel repertoires emerge. This happens under a large number of different parameter settings and therefore seems to be a very robust phenomenon. The emerged vowel systems show remarkable similarities with the vowel systems found in human languages. It is argued that self-organization probably plays an important role in determining the vowel inventories of human languages and that innate predispositions are probably not necessary to explain the universal tendencies of human vowel systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Fluent speech comprises sequences that are composed from a finite alphabet of learned words, syllables, and phonemes. The sequencing of discrete motor behaviors has received much attention in the motor control literature, but relatively little has been focused directly on speech production. In this paper, we investigate the cortical and subcortical regions involved in organizing and enacting sequences of simple speech sounds. Sparse event-triggered functional magnetic resonance imaging {(fMRI)} was used to measure responses to preparation and overt production of non-lexical three-syllable utterances, parameterized by two factors: syllable complexity and sequence complexity. The comparison of overt production trials to preparation only trials revealed a network related to the initiation of a speech plan, control of the articulators, and to hearing one's own voice. This network included the primary motor and somatosensory cortices, auditory cortical areas, supplementary motor area {(SMA),} the precentral gyrus of the insula, and portions of the thalamus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Additional stimulus complexity led to increased engagement of the basic speech network and recruitment of additional areas known to be involved in sequencing non-speech motor acts. In particular, the left hemisphere inferior frontal sulcus and posterior parietal cortex, and bilateral regions at the junction of the anterior insula and frontal operculum, the {SMA} and {pre-SMA,} the basal ganglia, anterior thalamus, and the cerebellum showed increased activity for more complex stimuli. We hypothesize mechanistic roles for the extended speech production network in the organization and execution of sequences of speech sounds.},

  Abstract                 = {An overview of the basic ideas of articulatory phonology is presented, along with selected examples of phonological patterning for which the approach seems to provide a particularly insightful account. In articulatory phonology, the basic units of phonological contrast are gestures, which are also abstract characterizations of articulatory events, each with an intrinsic time or duration. Utterances are modeled as organized patterns (constellations) of gestures, in which gestural units may overlap in time. The phonological structures defined in this way provide a set of articulatorily based natural classes. Moreover, the patterns of overlapping organization can be used to specify important aspects of the phonological structure of particular languages, and to account, in a coherent and general way, for a variety of different types of phonological variation. Such variation includes allophonic variation and fluent speech alternations, as well as 'coarticulation' and speech errors. Finally, it is suggested that the gestural approach clarifies our understanding of phonological development, by positing that prelinguistic units of action are harnessed into (gestural) phonological structures through differentiation and coordination.},

The use of gestures, rather than constellations of gestures as in Root nodes, as basic units of description makes it possible to characterise a variety of language patterns in which gestural organisation varies. Such patterns range from the misorderings of disordered speech through phonological rules involving gestural overlap and deletion to historical changes in which the overlap of gestures provides a crucial explanatory element.},

  Abstract                 = {Free-ranging vervet monkeys grunt to each other in a variety of social situations: when approaching a dominant or subordinate individual, when moving into a new area of their range, or when observing another group. Like other non-human primate vocalizations, these grunts have traditionally been interpreted as a single, highly variable call that reflects the arousal state of the signaller. Field playback experiments suggest, however, that what humans initially perceive as one grunt the monkeys perceive as at least four. Each grunt carries a specific meaning that seems to depend more on its acoustic properties than on the context in which it occurs. Results suggest that the vocalizations given by monkeys during social interactions may function in a rudimentary representational manner, as if to designate objects or events in the external world.},

  Abstract                 = {{Several parametric representations of the acoustic signal were compared with regard to word recognition performance in a syllable-oriented continuous speech recognition system. The vocabulary included many phonetically similar monosyllabic words, therefore the emphasis was on the ability to retain phonetically significant acoustic information in the face of syntactic and duration variations. For each parameter set (based on a mel-frequency cepstrum, a linear frequency cepstrum, a linear prediction cepstrum, a linear prediction spectrum, or a set of reflection coefficients), word templates were generated using an efficient dynamic warping method, and test data were time registered with the templates. A set of ten mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients computed every 6.4 ms resulted in the best performance, namely 96.5 percent and 95.0 percent recognition with each of two speakers. The superior performance of the mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients may be attributed to the fact that they better represent the perceptually relevant aspects of the short-term speech spectrum.}},

The term affordance is used to mean that visual cues are mapped directly to parameters that are relevant for motor interaction. In this paper, we present the {FARS} model of the cortical involvement in grasping, a model which focuses on the interaction between anterior intra-parietal area {(AIP)} and premotor area F5. The model represents the role of other intra-parietal areas, working in concert with inferotemporal cortex and F5, to provide {AIP} with a full range of information from which affordances may be derived. The model also suggests how task information and other constraints may resolve the action opportunities provided by multiple affordances. Our model demonstrates not only that posterior parietal cortex is a network of interacting subsystems, but also that it functions through a pattern of "cooperative computation" with a multiplicity of other brain regions. Finally, through the use of several novel tasks, the model allows us to make specific predictions regarding neural firing patterns at both the single unit and population levels, which aids in our further understanding of information encoding in these brain regions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a new, three dimensional vocal tract mechanical model for an anthropomorphic talking robot WT-7R (Waseda Talker No. 7 Refined), to improve the resonance of the vocal tract. The Waseda Talker robot series aims to reproduce the human speech mechanism with three-dimensional accuracy. The tongue of the previous model, WT-7 (Waseda Talker No. 7), was made of rigid links and covered with a thermoplastic rubber (Septon). This mechanism could deform the tongue shape and work as a part of the vocal tract, however, the cover thickness was not sufficient enough to prevent sound leakage, and did not have sufficient resonance. As a result, the produced sounds were unclear. To resolve this problem, the inner area of the tongue was filled with liquid. We experimented to select the filling liquid which is minimizes damage to the Septon cover and provides adequate resonance characteristics. The ethylene glycol was selected because it does little damage to the Septon and is relatively non-flammable. An oil seal and liquid gasket prevent leakage into the robot. WT-7 also has problems with its tongue link deformation range and open lip control range-these problems were also addressed. The improvements made the vowel production of WT-7R clearer than that of the previous robot, and the bandwidth of the formant peak in spectral analysis became sharper.},

As for the second claim, we review findings that support it and argue that although each of these findings may be explained by alternative accounts, the claim provides a single coherent account.

In the same area, "mirror neurones" fire both when the monkey observes another monkey grasping an object and when the monkey grasps that object. We used event-related {fMRI} to investigate where in the human brain activation can be found that reflects both canonical and mirror neuronal activity. There was activation in the intraparietal and ventral limbs of the precentral sulcus when subjects observed objects and when they executed movements in response to the objects (canonical neurones). There was activation in the dorsal premotor cortex, the intraparietal cortex, the parietal operculum {(SII),} and the superior temporal sulcus when subjects observed gestures (mirror neurones). Finally, activations in the ventral premotor cortex and inferior frontal gyrus (area 44) were found when subjects imitated gestures and executed movements in response to objects. We suggest that in the human brain, the ventral limb of the precentral sulcus may form part of the area designated F5 in the macaque monkey. It is possible that area 44 forms an anterior part of F5, though anatomical studies suggest that it may be a transitional area between the premotor and prefrontal cortices.},

  Abstract                 = {Speech production involves the integration of auditory, somatosensory, and motor information in the brain. This article describes a model of speech motor control in which a feedforward control system, involving premotor and primary motor cortex and the cerebellum, works in concert with auditory and somatosensory feedback control systems that involve both sensory and motor cortical areas. New speech sounds are learned by first storing an auditory target for the sound, then using the auditory feedback control system to control production of the sound in early repetitions. Repeated production of the sound leads to tuning of feedforward commands which eventually supplant the feedback-based control signals. Although parts of the model remain speculative, it accounts for a wide range of kinematic, acoustic, and neuroimaging data collected during speech production and provides a framework for investigating communication disorders that involve malfunction of the cerebral cortex and interconnected subcortical structures. Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to: (1) describe several types of learning that occur in the sensory-motor system during babbling and early speech, (2) identify three neural control subsystems involved in speech production, (3) identify regions of the brain involved in monitoring auditory and somatosensory feedback during speech production, and (4) identify regions of the brain involved in feedforward control of speech.},

A 4-part theoretical treatment favoring models whose only invariant targets are regions in auditory perceptual space over models that posit invariant constriction targets is presented. Auditory target regions are hypothesized to arise during development as an emergent property of neural map formation in the auditory system. Furthermore, speech movements are planned as trajectories in auditory perceptual space. These trajectories are then mapped into articulator movements through a neural mapping that allows motor equivalent variability in constriction locations and degrees when needed. These hypotheses are illustrated using computer simulations of the {DIVA} model of speech acquisition and production. Finally, several difficult challenges to proponents of constriction theories based on this theoretical treatment are posed.},

  Abstract                 = {{{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}There} has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the "symbol grounding problem": How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a {Chinese/Chinese} dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. {"An} X is a Y that is {Z").{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Connectionism} is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic "module," however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically "dedicated" symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

As a test of this hypothesis, we carried out a {4T} functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which subjects named visually presented objects sub-vocally. Group-based analyses showed that a majority of participants showed activation in two regions on the dorsal portion of the left posterior superior temporal gyrus.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite intensive work on language-brain relations, and a fairly impressive accumulation of knowledge over the last several decades, there has been little progress in developing large-scale models of the functional anatomy of language that integrate neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and psycholinguistic data. Drawing on relatively recent developments in the cortical organization of vision, and on data from a variety of sources, we propose a new framework for understanding aspects of the functional anatomy of language which moves towards remedying this situation. The framework posits that early cortical stages of speech perception involve auditory fields in the superior temporal gyrus bilaterally (although asymmetrically). This cortical processing system then diverges into two broad processing streams, a ventral stream, which is involved in mapping sound onto meaning, and a dorsal stream, which is involved in mapping sound onto articulatory-based representations. The ventral stream projects ventro-laterally toward inferior posterior temporal cortex (posterior middle temporal gyrus) which serves as an interface between sound-based representations of speech in the superior temporal gyrus (again bilaterally) and widely distributed conceptual representations. The dorsal stream projects dorso-posteriorly involving a region in the posterior Sylvian fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary (area Spt), and ultimately projecting to frontal regions. This network provides a mechanism for the development and maintenance of "parity" between auditory and motor representations of speech. Although the proposed dorsal stream represents a very tight connection between processes involved in speech perception and speech production, it does not appear to be a critical component of the speech perception process under normal (ecologically natural) listening conditions, that is, when speech input is mapped onto a conceptual representation. We also propose some degree of bi-directionality in both the dorsal and ventral pathways. We discuss some recent empirical tests of this framework that utilize a range of methods. We also show how damage to different components of this framework can account for the major symptom clusters of the fluent aphasias, and discuss some recent evidence concerning how sentence-level processing might be integrated into the framework.},

We found neurons in monkey premotor cortex that discharge when the animal performs a specific action and when it hears the related sound. Most of the neurons also discharge when the monkey observes the same action. These audiovisual mirror neurons code actions independently of whether these actions are performed, heard, or seen. This discovery in the monkey homolog of Broca's area might shed light on the origin of language: audiovisual mirror neurons code abstract contents{\textemdash}the meaning of actions{\textemdash}and have the auditory access typical of human language to these contents.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews two reflexive motor patterns in humans: Primitive reflexes and motor primitives. Both terms coexist in the literature of motor development and motor control, yet they are not synonyms. While primitive reflexes are a part of the temporary motor repertoire in early ontogeny, motor primitives refer to sets of motor patterns that are considered basic units of voluntary motor control thought to be present throughout the life-span. The article provides an overview of the anatomy and neurophysiology of human reflexive motor patterns to elucidate that both concepts are rooted in architecture of the spinal cord. I will advocate that an understanding of the human motor system that encompasses both primitive reflexes and motor primitives as well as the interaction with supraspinal motor centers will lead to an appreciation of the richness of the human motor repertoire, which in turn seems imperative for designing epigenetic robots and highly adaptable human machine interfaces.},

The capacities of this programming method are demonstrated through a succession of increasingly complex experiments. Starting from the learning of simple reactive behaviors, we present instances of behavior combination, sensor fusion, hierarchical behavior composition, situation recognition and temporal sequencing. This series of experiments comprises the steps in the incremental development of a complex robot program. The advantages and drawbacks of {BRP} are discussed along with these different experiments and summed up as a conclusion. These different robotics programs may be seen as an illustration of probabilistic programming applicable whenever one must deal with problems based on uncertain or incomplete knowledge. The scope of possible applications is obviously much broader than robotics.},

  Abstract                 = {A numerical model is developed in order to establish the extent to which the principle of maximal perceptual contrast can be used in phonological theory to explain the phonetic structure of vowel systems. Preliminary results obtained with the model indicate that perceptual contrast appears to play an important role as a determinant of such systems. Therefore, it is likely that this principle (along with other factors) should be included among the variables in an explanatory phonological theory. However, the incorporation of numerically stated conditions on phonological structure appears to presuppose a formalism different from that which has developed within current descriptions of phonology. Some refinements and extensions of the present framework are suggested. It is proposed that predictions of phonological facts be derived as consequences of the structure of the mechanisms available for human speech communication and the optimization of their use. Such an extension would constitute a theory that would be different from traditional {'Saussurean'} linguistics in several respects; e.g., it would be quantitative, and deliberately substance-based. The research reported represents a preliminary attempt to apply such a program.},

Though classical teaching of aphasia syndromes holds that people with Broca's aphasia have intact comprehension at the single-word level, the nature and extent of this purported sparing were explored under suboptimal processing conditions. A combination of acoustic distortions (low-pass filtering and time compression) was used to probe for "break points" in lexical comprehension in a group of individuals with aphasia. Results suggest that accurate and efficient lexical processing is vulnerable to suboptimal listening climates, and that processing under these conditions reveals the continuous nature of the impairment of linguistic behaviors observed in individuals with aphasia.},

  Abstract                 = {We bridge the gap between two issues in infant development: vocal development and intrinsic motivation. We propose and experimentally test the hypothesis that general mechanisms of intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration, also called curiosity-driven learning, can self-organize developmental stages during early vocal learning. We introduce a computational model of intrinsically motivated vocal exploration, which allows the learner to autonomously structure its own vocal experiments, and thus its own learning schedule, through a drive to maximize competence progress. This model relies on a physical model of the vocal tract, the auditory system and the agent's motor control as well as vocalizations of social peers. We present computational experiments that show how such a mechanism can explain the adaptive transition from vocal self-exploration with little influence from the speech environment, to a later stage where vocal exploration becomes influenced by vocalizations of peers. Within the initial self-exploration phase, we show that a sequence of vocal production stages self-organizes, and shares properties with data from infant developmental psychology: the vocal learner first discovers how to control phonation, then focuses on vocal variations of unarticulated sounds, and finally automatically discovers and focuses on babbling with articulated proto-syllables. As the vocal learner becomes more proficient at producing complex sounds, imitating vocalizations of peers starts to provide high learning progress explaining an automatic shift from self-exploration to vocal imitation.},

These two explorations mechanisms are: 1) goal babbling, 2) active learning driven by the maximization of empirically measured learning progress. We show how this generic framework allows to model several recent algorithmic architectures for exploration. Then, we propose a particular implementation using Gaussian Mixture Models, which at the same time provides an original empirical measure of the competence progress. Finally, we perform computer simulations on two simulated setups: the control of the end effector of a 7-DoF arm and the control of the formants produced by an articulatory synthesizer.},

This issue concerns multiple and diverse fields such as engineering, economics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science and many others. Basically, an agent has to choose a single or series of actions from a set of options, without knowing for sure their consequences. Schematically, two main approaches have been followed: either the agent learns which option is the correct one to choose in a given situation by trial and error, or the agent already has some knowledge on the possible consequences of his decisions; this knowledge being generally expressed as a conditional probability distribution. In the latter case, several optimal or suboptimal methods have been proposed to exploit this uncertain knowledge in various contexts. In this work, we propose following a different approach, based on the geometric intuition of distance. More precisely, we define a goal independent quasimetric structure on the state space, taking into account both cost function and transition probability. We then compare precision and computation time with classical approaches.}},

  Abstract                 = {The speech code is a vehicle of language: it defines a set of forms used by a community to carry information. Such a code is necessary to support the linguistic interactions that allow humans to communicate. How then may a speech code be formed prior to the existence of linguistic interactions? Moreover, the human speech code is discrete and compositional, shared by all the individuals of a community but different across communities, and phoneme inventories are characterized by statistical regularities. How can a speech code with these properties form? We try to approach these questions in the paper, using the "methodology of the artificial". We build a society of artificial agents, and detail a mechanism that shows the formation of a discrete speech code without pre-supposing the existence of linguistic capacities or of coordinated interactions. The mechanism is based on a low-level model of sensory-motor interactions. We show that the integration of certain very simple and non-language-specific neural devices leads to the formation of a speech code that has properties similar to the human speech code. This result relies on the self-organizing properties of a generic coupling between perception and production within agents, and on the interactions between agents. The artificial system helps us to develop better intuitions on how speech might have appeared, by showing how self-organization might have helped natural selection to find speech.},

  Abstract                 = {Action and perception are functionally linked in the brain, but a hotly debated question is whether perception and comprehension of stimuli depend on motor circuits. Brain language mechanisms are ideal for addressing this question. Neuroimaging investigations have found specific motor activations when subjects understand speech sounds, word meanings and sentence structures. Moreover, studies involving transcranial magnetic stimulation and patients with lesions affecting inferior frontal regions of the brain have shown contributions of motor circuits to the comprehension of phonemes, semantic categories and grammar. These data show that language comprehension benefits from frontocentral action systems, indicating that action and perception circuits are interdependent.},

  Abstract                 = {The processing of spoken language has been attributed to areas in the superior temporal lobe, where speech stimuli elicit the greatest activation. However, neurobiological and psycholinguistic models have long postulated that knowledge about the articulatory features of individual phonemes has an important role in their perception and in speech comprehension. To probe the possible involvement of specific motor circuits in the speech-perception process, we used event-related functional {MRI} and presented experimental subjects with spoken syllables, including [p] and [t] sounds, which are produced by movements of the lips or tongue, respectively. Physically similar nonlinguistic signal-correlated noise patterns were used as control stimuli. In localizer experiments, subjects had to silently articulate the same syllables and, in a second task, move their lips or tongue. Speech perception most strongly activated superior temporal cortex. Crucially, however, distinct motor regions in the precentral gyrus sparked by articulatory movements of the lips and tongue were also differentially activated in a somatotopic manner when subjects listened to the lip- or tongue-related phonemes. This sound-related somatotopic activation in precentral gyrus shows that, during speech perception, specific motor circuits are recruited that reflect phonetic distinctive features of the speech sounds encountered, thus providing direct neuroimaging support for specific links between the phonological mechanisms for speech perception and production.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite a growing interest in the question of tool-use development in infants, no study so far has systematically investigated how learning to use a tool to retrieve an out-of-reach object progresses with age. This was the first aim of this study, in which 60 infants, aged 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22&#xa0;months, were presented with an attractive toy and a rake-like tool. There were five conditions of spatial relationships between the toy and the tool, going from the toy and tool being connected to there being a large spatial gap between them. A second aim of the study was to evaluate at what age infants who spontaneously fail the task can learn this complex skill by being given a demonstration from an adult. Results show that even some of the youngest infants could spontaneously retrieve the toy when it was presented inside and touching the top part of the tool. In contrast, in conditions with a spatial gap, the first spontaneous successes were observed at 18&#xa0;months, suggesting that a true understanding of the use of the tool has not been fully acquired before that age. Interestingly, it is also at 18&#xa0;months that infants began to benefit from the demonstration in the conditions with a spatial gap. The developmental steps for tool use observed here are discussed in terms of changes in infants’ ability to attend to more than one item in the environment. The work provides insight into the progressive understanding of tool use during infancy and into how observational learning improves with age. },

These neurons (mirror neurons) appear to represent a system that matches observed events to similar, internally generated actions, and in this way forms a link between the observer and the actor. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and positron emission tomography {(PET)} experiments suggest that a mirror system for gesture recognition also exists in humans and includes Broca's area. We propose here that such an observation/execution matching system provides a necessary bridge from'doing' to'communicating',as the link between actor and observer becomes a link between the sender and the receiver of each message.},

We posit, then, that this motor representation is at the basis of the understanding of motor events. Finally, on the basis of some recent data showing that, in man, the observation of motor actions activate the posterior part of inferior frontal gyrus, we suggest that the development of the lateral verbal communication system in man derives from a more ancient communication system based on recognition of hand and face gestures.},

  Abstract                 = {{Purpose: This paper investigates jaw-finger coordination in a task involving pointing to a target while naming it with a 'CVCV (e.g. /'papa/) vs. CV'CV (e.g. /pa'pa/) word. According to our working hypothesis, the pointing apex (gesture extremum) would be synchronized with the apex of the jaw opening gesture corresponding to the stressed syllable. Method:Jaw and finger motions were recorded using Optotrak. The effects of stress position on jaw-finger coordination were tested across different target positions (near vs. far) and different consonants in the target word (/t/ vs. /p/). Twenty native Portuguese Brazilian speakers participated in the experiment (all conditions). Results: Jaw response starts earlier and finger-target alignment period is longer for CV'CV words than for 'CVCV ones. The apex of the jaw opening gesture for the stressed syllable appears synchronized to the onset of the finger-target alignment period (corresponding to the pointing apex) for 'CVCV words, and with the offset of that period for CV'CV ones. Conclusions:For both stress conditions, the stressed syllable occurs within the finger-target alignment period due to tight finger-jaw coordination. This result is interpreted as an evidence for an anchoring of the speech deictic site (part of speech that shows) in the pointing gesture.}},

  Abstract                 = {{The brain easily generates the movement that is needed in a given situation. Yet surprisingly, the results of experimental studies suggest that it is difficult to acquire more than one skill at a time. To do so, it has generally been necessary to link the required movement to arbitrary cues. In the present study, we show that speech motor learning provides an informative model for the acquisition of multiple sensorimotor skills. During training, subjects were required to repeat aloud individual words in random order while auditory feedback was altered in real-time in different ways for the different words. We found that subjects can quite readily and simultaneously modify their speech movements to correct for these different auditory transformations. This multiple learning occurs effortlessly without explicit cues and without any apparent awareness of the perturbation. The ability to simultaneously learn several different auditory-motor transformations is consistent with the idea that, in speech motor learning, the brain acquires instance-specific memories. The results support the hypothesis that speech motor learning is fundamentally local.}},

For the two types of disyllables: (1) the speeding process induces a shift from two jaw cycles per disyllable to a single cycle; (2) this shift modifies the coordination between the jaw and the constrictors and (3) comes with a progression towards either a LaCo attractor (e.g. (/pata/ or /tapa/)->/pat{\'a}/->/pt{\'a}/) or a CoLa one (e.g. (/pata/ or /tapa/->/tap{\'a}/->/tp{\'a}/). Yet, (4) the LaCo attractor is clearly favored regardless of the initial sequencing. These results are interpreted as evidence that a LaCo CVCV disyllable could be a more stable coordinative pattern for the lip-tongue-jaw motor system than a CoLa one. They are discussed in relation with the so-called LC effect that is the preference for LaCo associations rather than CoLa ones in CV.CV disyllables in both world languages and infants' first words.}},

  Abstract                 = {A perceptual analysis of the French vowel [u] produced by 10 speakers under normal and perturbed conditions {(Savariaux} et al., 1995) is presented which aims at characterizing in the perceptual domain the task of a speaker for this vowel, and, then, at understanding the strategies developed by the speakers to deal with the lip perturbation. Identification and rating tests showed that the French [u] is perceptually fairly well described in the {[F1,} {(F2-F0)]} plane, and that the parameter {(((F2-F0)} + F1)/2) (all frequencies in bark) provides a good overall correlate of the "grave" feature classically used to describe the vowel [u] in all languages. This permitted reanalysis of the behavior of the speakers during the perturbation experiment. Three of them succeed in producing a good [u] in spite of the lip tube, thanks to a combination of limited changes on F1 and {(F2-F0),} but without producing the strong backward movement of the tongue, which would be necessary to keep the {[F1,F2]} pattern close to the one measured in normal speech. The only speaker who strongly moved his tongue back and maintained F1 and F2 at low values did not produce a perceptually well-rated [u], but additional tests demonstrate that this gesture allowed him to preserve the most important phonetic features of the French [u], which is primarily a back and rounded vowel. It is concluded that speech production is clearly guided by perceptual requirements, and that the speakers have a good representation of them, even if they are not all able to meet them in perturbed conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {It is an old-standing debate in the field of speech communication to determine whether speech perception involves auditory or multisensory representations and processing, independently on any procedural knowledge about the production of speech units or on the contrary if it is based on a recoding of the sensory input in terms of articulatory gestures, as posited in the Motor Theory of Speech Perception. The discovery of mirror neurons in the last 15 years has strongly renewed the interest for motor theories. However, while these neurophysiological data clearly reinforce the plausibility of the role of motor properties in perception, it could lead in our view to incorrectly de-emphasise the role of perceptual shaping, crucial in speech communication. The so-called {Perception-for-Action-Control} Theory {(PACT)} aims at defining a theoretical framework connecting in a principled way perceptual shaping and motor procedural knowledge in speech multisensory processing in the human brain. In this paper, the theory is presented in details. It is described how this theory fits with behavioural and linguistic data, concerning firstly vowel systems in human languages, and secondly the perceptual organization of the speech scene. Finally a neuro-computational framework is presented in connection with recent data on the possible functional role of the motor system in speech perception.},

  Abstract                 = {The {Dispersion-Focalization} Theory {(DFT)} attempts to predict vowel systems based on the minimization of an energy function summing two perceptual components: global dispersion, which is based on inter-vowel distances; and local focalization, which is based on intra-vowel spectral salience related to the proximity of formants. The computation takes place in an auditory (formant-based) space, and is controlled by two parameters,[lambda],which sets the respective weight of F1and higher formants in auditory distances, and[alpha],which sets the respective weights of the dispersion and focalization components. In this study, we first sample the acoustic space with 33 "prototypes" associated with the major primary articulations for vowels. Then, for a given number of vowels, we define two different tools, "phase spaces" for dealing with optimal systems and "stability " for characterizing sub-optimal ones. The corresponding predictions are compared with the main trends of vowel systems analyzed in a companion paper {(Schwartz,} Bo{\"e}, Vallée \& Abry, this issue). We then derive a region in the ([lambda], [alpha])space for which theory predictions fit quite well with phonological inventories, with a special concern for two problems, namely peripheral vowels and front rounded vowels. Finally we stress the difficulty of predicting some trends of vowel systems linked to the organization of vowels in series, which could constitute a limit to substance-based predictions of vowel inventories.},

  Abstract                 = {A striking property of speech perception is its resilience in the face of acoustic variability (among speech sounds produced by different speakers at different times, for example). The robustness of speech perception might, in part, result from multiple, complementary representations of the input, which operate in both acoustic-phonetic feature-based and articulatory-gestural domains. Recent studies of the anatomical and functional organization of the non-human primate auditory cortical system point to multiple, parallel, hierarchically organized processing pathways that involve the temporal, parietal and frontal cortices. Functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that a similar organization might underlie speech perception in humans. These parallel, hierarchical processing 'streams', both within and across hemispheres, might operate on distinguishable, complementary types of representations and subserve complementary types of processing. Two long-opposing views of speech perception have posited a basis either in acoustic feature processing or in gestural motor processing; the view put forward here might help reconcile these positions.},

  Abstract                 = {Life-long robot learning in the high-dimensional real world requires guided and structured exploration mechanisms. In this developmental context, we investigate here the use of the recently proposed PI2-CMAES episodic reinforcement learning algorithm, which is able to learn high-dimensional motor tasks through adaptive control of exploration. By studying PI2-CMAES in a reaching task on a simulated arm, we observe two developmental properties. First, we show how PI2-CMAES autonomously and continuously tunes the global exploration/exploitation trade-off, allowing it to re-adapt to changing tasks. Second, we show how PI2-CMAES spontaneously self-organizes a maturational structure whilst exploring the degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) of the motor space. In particular, it automatically demonstrates the so-called \emph{proximo-distal maturation} observed in humans: after first freezing distal DOFs while exploring predominantly the most proximal DOF, it progressively frees exploration in DOFs along the proximo-distal body axis. These emergent properties suggest the use of PI2-CMAES as a general tool for studying reinforcement learning of skills in life-long developmental learning contexts.},

A linear regression line ("locus equation") was fit to the cluster of F2 coordinates per stop place category produced during each month. The slope of the regression lines provided a numerical index of vowel-induced coarticulation on consonant productions. Labial, alveolar, and velar {CV} productions followed distinct articulatory paths toward adult-like norms of coarticulation. Inferences about the gradual emergence of segmental independence of the consonant and vowel in the three stop place environments were made from locus equation scatterplots and mean F2 onset and F2 midvowel frequencies obtained across babbling, early words, and natural speech.},

  Abstract                 = {Neuroethological investigations of mammalian and avian auditory systems have documented species-specific specializations for processing complex acoustic signals that could, if viewed in abstract terms, have an intriguing and striking relevance for human speech sound categorization and representation. Each species forms biologically relevant categories based on combinatorial analysis of information-bearing parameters within the complex input signal. This target article uses known neural models from the mustached bat and barn owl to develop, by analogy, a conceptualization of human processing of consonant plus vowel sequences that offers a partial solution to the noninvariance dilemma--the nontransparent relationship between the acoustic waveform and the phonetic segment. Critical input sound parameters used to establish species-specific categories in the mustached bat and barn owl exhibit high correlation and linearity due to physical laws. A cue long known to be relevant to the perception of stop place of articulation is the second formant {(F2)} transition. This article describes an empirical phenomenon--the locus equations--that describes the relationship between the F2 of a vowel and the F2 measured at the onset of a consonant-vowel {(CV)} transition. These variables, F2 onset and F2 vowel within a given place category, are consistently and robustly linearly correlated across diverse speakers and languages, and even under perturbation conditions as imposed by bite blocks. A functional role for this category-level extreme correlation and linearity (the "orderly output constraint") is hypothesized based on the notion of an evolutionarily conserved auditory-processing strategy. High correlation and linearity between critical parameters in the speech signal that help to cue place of articulation categories might have evolved to satisfy a preadaptation by mammalian auditory systems for representing tightly correlated, linearly related components of acoustic signals.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose that the crucial difference between human cognition and that of other species is the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions: shared intentionality. Participation in such activities requires not only especially powerful forms of intention reading and cultural learning, but also a unique motivation to share psychological states with others and unique forms of cognitive representation for doing so. The result of participating in these activities is species-unique forms of cultural cognition and evolution, enabling everything from the creation and use of linguistic symbols to the construction of social norms and individual beliefs to the establishment of social institutions. In support of this proposal we argue and present evidence that great apes (and some children with autism) understand the basics of intentional action, but they still do not participate in activities involving joint intentions and attention (shared intentionality). Human children's skills of shared intentionality develop gradually during the first 14 months of life as two ontogenetic pathways intertwine: (1) the general ape line of understanding others as animate, goal-directed, and intentional agents; and (2) a species-unique motivation to share emotions, experience, and activities with other persons. The developmental outcome is children's ability to construct dialogic cognitive representations, which enable them to participate in earnest in the collectivity that is human cognition.},

Acoustic measurements showed compensation to the shift within approximately 136 ms of onset. Neuroimaging revealed increased activity in bilateral superior temporal cortex during shifted feedback, indicative of neurons coding mismatches between expected and actual auditory signals, as well as right prefrontal and Rolandic cortical activity. Structural equation modeling revealed increased influence of bilateral auditory cortical areas on right frontal areas during shifted speech, indicating that projections from auditory error cells in posterior superior temporal cortex to motor correction cells in right frontal cortex mediate auditory feedback control of speech.},

To this end, actions of the sense organs that improve the encoding of the sensory data trigger an internally generated reinforcement signal. Here it is argued that the same IML mechanism might also support the development of imitation when general actions beyond those of the sense organs are considered: The learner first observes a tutor performing a behavior and learns a model of the the behavior's sensory consequences. The learner then acts itself and receives an internally generated reinforcement signal reflecting how well the sensory consequences of its own behavior are encoded by the sensory model. Actions that are more similar to those of the tutor will lead to sensory signals that are easier to encode and produce a higher reinforcement signal. Through this, the learner's behavior is progressively tuned to make the sensory consequences of its actions match the learned sensory model. I discuss this mechanism in the context of human language acquisition and bird song learning where similar ideas have been proposed. The suggested mechanism also offers an account for the development of mirror neurons and makes a number of predictions. Overall, it establishes a connection between principles of efficient coding, intrinsic motivations and imitation.},

  Abstract                 = {The perception of action is associated with increased activity in motor regions, implicating such regions in the recognition, understanding and imitation of actions. We examined the possibility that perception of speech, both auditory and visual, would also result in changes in the excitability of the motor system underlying speech production. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the face area of primary motor cortex to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the lip muscles. The size of the motor-evoked potentials was compared under the following conditions: listening to speech, listening to non-verbal sounds, viewing speech-related lip movements, and viewing eye and brow movements. Compared to control conditions, listening to and viewing speech enhanced the size of the motor-evoked potential. This effect was only seen in response to stimulation of the left hemisphere; stimulation of the right hemisphere produced no changes in motor-evoked potentials in any of the conditions. In a control experiment, the size of the motor-evoked potentials elicited in the muscles of the right hand did not differ among conditions, suggesting that speech-related changes in excitability are specific to the lip muscles. These results provide evidence that both auditory and visual speech perception facilitate the excitability of the motor system involved in speech production.},

We review the behavioral evidence and benefits of modularity, and propose a new architecture based on multiple pairs of inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. Within each pair, the inverse and forward models are tightly coupled both during their acquisition, through motor learning, and use, during which the forward models determine the contribution of each inverse model's output to the final motor command. This architecture can simultaneously learn the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given environment. Finally, we describe specific predictions of the model, which can be tested experimentally.},
